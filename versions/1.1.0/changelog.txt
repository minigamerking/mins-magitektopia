This is the first version to truly feel like an actual modpack
It adds many mods that help with making the pack feel like an actual modpack.
These include ModpackUtils, Modpack Update Checker, and FancyMenu

I will make the menu look less like the vanilla one soon.

The additions to the modpack are as follows:

- Create: Extended Wrenches
- Create: Factory Logistics
- Foggy Pale Garden
- Better Client
- More Relics
- Crash Assistant

I also removed the SimpleMenu mod because I decided to use FancyMenu instead
